- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (optional, for containerized development)
- Git

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Weather-App.git
   cd Weather-App
   ```

2. **Start the backend**
   ```bash
   cd WeatherDashboardAPI
   dotnet restore
   dotnet run
   ```

3. **Start the frontend** (in a new terminal)
   ```bash
   cd weather-dashboard-frontend
   node server.js
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5101

### Using Docker for Development

```bash
# Start all services with Docker
./start.sh

# Or manually
docker compose up --build

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker compose down
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code style
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep changes focused and atomic

### 3. Test Your Changes

#### Backend Testing

```bash
cd WeatherDashboardAPI
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

Test the API endpoints:
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5101/api/weather/test

# Get weather
curl "http://localhost:5101/api/weather?city=London"
```

#### Frontend Testing

1. Start the frontend server
2. Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser
3. Test all features:
   - Search for cities
   - GPS location detection
   - Theme toggle
   - Favorite cities
   - Search history

### 4. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: brief description"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub.

## Code Style Guidelines

### Backend (C#)

- Follow Microsoft's [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and single-purpose

### Frontend (JavaScript)

- Use ES6+ syntax
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`
- Use arrow functions where appropriate
- Follow consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
- Add comments for complex logic

### CSS

- Follow BEM naming convention where applicable
- Group related styles together
- Add comments for complex styles
